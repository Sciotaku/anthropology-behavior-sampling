This repository contains all the components of the data science module for Dartmouth College's ANTH 20: Primate Evolution and Ecology.  Click the icon next to the course name above to download the entire module.

## Primary Objective

The primary objective for this module is to have students understand the respective strengths and weaknesses of the two main data collection methods used in research on primate behavior, focal bout sampling and instantaneous scan sampling


## Student Expectations

Give details of what students have as background.  Do we expect them to have certain skills? Does the course have prerequisites? etc.

## Learning Objectives
1.	Collect data using both methods
2. Define their own ethnogram and apply it in data collection
3. Analyze visualizations of thedata in order to enrich class discussion
