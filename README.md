## Module Description 
Primate Evolution and Ecology (ANTH 20) is an introductory course in the Anthropology department where students learn about primate evolution and the interaction with the ecological surroundings.  In field work with primates, there are two main methods of data collection _focal bout sampling_ and _instantaneous scan sampling_.  The purpose of the module is to have students understand the respective strengths and weaknesses of these methods.  This module is a medium length module (3 days), uses Excel as its main tool and covers data science areas of acquiring data, analyzing data, and drawing conclusions.
